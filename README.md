# YT-Music-Downloader
I have written a python script which lets you download youtube music to your pc.

# Features
  - Any audio files can be downloaded with YT Link
  - Any YT Playlist can be downloaded with YT Playlist Link
  - It includes feature of downloading to your preferred directory / folder in your pc.
  - The executable file will run in any windows, mac, linux machine
# Drawback
  - Takes a while to download (depends on the size)
  - Folder paths should have full path link
  - Does not have GUI (CLI Application). Gui coming soon..
# How to use
Download the exe file and run the file. The exe file can be found [Exe File](/dist)
